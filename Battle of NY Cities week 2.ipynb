These Foursquare calls using the cities name and latitude and longitude values and in return they return venue data. With this new data analysis happens by grouping cities and taking the mean frequency of occurrence of each venue category. This is in preparation of clustering the data. \n\nThen we cluster neighborhoods using K-means clustering method. In this case we use 5 clusters which can cover the complexity of our problem. After clustering we will update our dataset and create a column representing the group for each neighborhood.\n\nThe user also has a chance to see the rating of the chosen venue in the city of interest. As well as any trending venues in that city.
